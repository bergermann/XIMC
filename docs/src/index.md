# XIMC (WIP)
Julia wrapper for XIMC motor control package by Standa (www.standa.lt).  
The standard wrapper has been expanded for ease of use and to conform more to Julian standards.  

This module was created as part of the MADMAX project at RWTH Aachen.
The functionality is suited to the needs of one project and therefore
offers not yet the full functionality possible.

This documentation gives a overview over the package and its usage.
For a quick start see [Getting Started](@ref).
